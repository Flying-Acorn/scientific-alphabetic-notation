This project offers a formatting system designed to display large numbers within your game.

In games such as idle games, player scores can escalate to significant magnitudes. To address this, the numbers are often showcased in scientific notation with a bijective exponent systemâ€”from 'a' to 'z', 'aa' to 'ab', and beyond.

Powered by the "big double" system from "BreakInfinity" (https://github.com/Razenpok/BreakInfinity.cs), this project handles the display of large numbers by converting them to a scientific format utilizing a 26-base bijective component system.
